# Project Title

RTA Road Safety And Street View Data Analysis


## Summary

World Health Organisation data indicates that approximately 3,200 people die in Road Traffic Accidents globally every day.  The vast majority of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, and it has been estimated that at least 100 million people have died on the roads since the era of the motor car began.  An enormous amount of research has been undertaken into the underlying causation and the optimal remedial action needed to address this issue, and in many instances this work has fallen into the three areas of education, engineering and enforcement.
I believe Artificial Intelligence offers a phenomenal opportunity to leverage data regarding accident frequency and location against "street view" imagery of the global road network to sift and intelligently categorise the many relevant physical variables.  If AI could be utilised to review accident sites in detail, intelligently, and at far greater speed than informed humans could, I believe it would firstly inform our current understanding and assumptions regarding RTA causation, and secondly, contribute to an overall reduction in road deaths worldwide.
Addressing the huge human toll of RTAs and its disproportionate impact on less affluent nations would also serve to demonstrate the immense potential AI offers to improve life.


## Background

Whilst significant data exists regarding prevalent variables in RTA occurrence (weather, visibility, road layout, signage), direct comparisons of sites globally in order to identify and quantify common factors has to my knowledge not been undertaken hitherto.

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* problem 1
* problem 2
* etc.


## How is it used?

I envisage the responsible national agencies as the primary users of this facility, and the local and regional departments (local authorities, emergency services) through which they responsiblity is enacted.
The output of the analysis could be used in a number of ways:
* in its simplest terms identification of the most signifcant variables in RTA frequency could be used to inform government policy on road safety (for example, to adjust the relative emphasis given to speed limit compliance and education regarding signage)
* poorer nations could utilise the data to identify the most cost effective measures that could be taken to improve the safety of their roads, and to validate proposals regarding new layouts
* specific recommendations regarding current approaches to road design could be made, with data made available on a compartive basis (so that, for example, a new road layout could be actively compared with similar examples globally)
* longitudinal analysis could be taken in the longer term, to validate or refute measures targeted at safety improvement.

## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
